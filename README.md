# simple-image-recognition_coursera
## Summary ##
1. Built L-layers neural network that can recognise cats.
2. Implemented different types of function including RELU and Sigmoid.
3. Given all factors being constant, increasing the number of layers decreases the cost significantly, thus increasing the accuracy of the model.
